    <p>These Terms of Service (these “Terms”) include the legal terms that we require all developers and other users to accept and implement as a condition of accessing our web services located at <a href="http://www.versatilesmshub.com">www.versatilesmshub.com</a> and other websites owned and/or operated by VeUp Technologies Private Limited (the “Website(s)”), and/or accessing or using the application programming interfaces provided on or in connection with the VeUp Technologies Private Limited Platform (“API(s)”), including any documentation, materials, code, data (such as logs as defined below), files (such as AIML and Other Files as defined below) and other information or materials made available to you by VeUp Technologies Private Limited on or in connection with the APIs (collectively, “VeUp Technologies Private Limited Content”) to develop Bots for use in your products or devices (“Devices”) and/or your software applications (“Application(s)”).</p>
    <p>The “Versatile Platform” includes a sandbox environment and developer portal designed to allow you to access, upload, download, edit, create, store, and interpret files and data in connection with building, hosting, and deploying your Bots.
